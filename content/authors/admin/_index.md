Iâ€™m a research fellow in the Blesh Lab at the University of Michigan - School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS). My current research focuses on investigating crop productivity and soil nutrient cycling in perennial agricultural systems. Specifically I lead a field experiment looking at the effects of intercropping perennial legumes with a novel perennial wheat crop to assess the effects of legumes on perennial wheat production and soil health. My previous research focused on identifying sustainable agricultural practices with a focus on smallholder farming systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. In my PhD work I focused on maize-legume cropping systems in Tanzania at different scales taking an interdisciplinary approach to evaluating legume production through integrating field trials, on-farm assessments, and current extension systems.
