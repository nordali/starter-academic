Iâ€™m a post-doctoral research associate for the Snapp Lab at Michigan State University (MSU). My research focuses on identifying sustainable agricultural practices with a focus on smallholder farming systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. My PhD research focused on maize-legume cropping systems in Tanzania at different scales taking an interdisciplinary approach to evaluating legume production through integrating field trials, on-farm assessments, and current extension systems. Check out my work below and feel free to reach out with collaboration ideas!
