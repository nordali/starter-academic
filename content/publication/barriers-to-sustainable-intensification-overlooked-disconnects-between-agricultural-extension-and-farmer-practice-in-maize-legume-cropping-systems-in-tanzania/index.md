abstract: Effective extension systems are vital to smallholder agriculture.
  Education on sustainable management involves complex interactions and
  communication flows among information providers and practitioners. Farmer
  practice is often overlooked within extension knowledge systems, resulting in
  incompatible recommendations and barriers to sustainable agriculture. This
  study investigates the diversity of smallholder agricultural practices, with a
  focus on maize-legume systems in Tanzania, including seasonal cropping
  patterns and management, as well as linkages to extension recommendations and
  information flows. We used a mixed methods approach to assess the state of
  extension and farmer practice around maize-legume production in Tanzania.
  Household and plot-level survey data (n = 220) and focus group discussions (n
  = 5) and extension information was ascertained through interviews with key
  stakeholders (n = 12) and a survey of village-based extension advisors (n =
  193). We found legume management practices were highly local. In the Southern
  Highlands for example, farmers produced from one to three bean crops per year,
  using a range of planting arrangements. Further, extension recommendations
  often did not take into account the varieties, fertilizer or plant spacing
  used by farmers. This comprehensive study of extension knowledge systems in
  Tanzania highlights the persistent disconnects that occur at multiple levels,
  acting as a barrier to sustainable intensification of smallholder farming.
