abstract = {Climate change is posing severe challenges in Africa, where resilient crops are urgently needed to withstand drought periods and unreliable rainfall. Multi-purpose legume species, such as lablab (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet), have been under-utilized yet have the potential to overcome climate challenges. While lablab is native to Africa, there are few characterized varieties and it is under-utilized by smallholder farmers due to a lack of information and access to varieties. Knowledge is especially lacking on the performance of this crop by genotype, management, and environment. We conducted a two-year field study at two sites to evaluate 29 lablab cultivars under sole and maize intercrop management, with 14 cultivars selected for in-depth study. Cultivars were evaluated on vegetative biomass and grain yield production, with N fixation assessed for one site year. Biomass and grain production differed across environments and cultivars, with only biomass affected by intercropping. Average grain yield was substantially reduced to only 37 kg ha-1 in environments with maximum temperatures greater than 33C, but biomass production yielded comparable amounts across high temperatures and in dry ({\textless}500 mm rainfall) environments. Tradeoffs were found between biomass and grain yield across high yielding cultivars, with the top three grain accessions averaging 612 kg ha-1 of grain and 1.97 Mg ha-1 biomass whereas the top three biomass accessions produced 327 kg ha-1 grain and 2.52 Mg ha-1 biomass across all environments. In a comparison of production and N fixation measurements, cultivars were identified which may have high performance in both. Suitability of lablab for grain and biomass production were visualized across Tanzania in a map comparing max temperature thresholds for grain and biomass against average regional livestock populations. This provides a way forward for identifying potential areas for lablab cultivation as a novel means to enhance fodder and pulse production with smallholder farmers.},
