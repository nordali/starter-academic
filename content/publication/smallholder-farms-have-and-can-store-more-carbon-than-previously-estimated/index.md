abstract: Increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is increasingly targeted
  as a key strategy in climate change mitigation and improved ecosystem
  resiliency. Agricultural land, a dominant global land use, provides
  substantial challenges and opportunities for global carbon sequestration.
  Despite this, global estimates of soil carbon sequestration potential often
  exclude agricultural land and estimates are coarse for regions in the Global
  South. To address these discrepancies and improve estimates, we develop a
  hybrid, data-augmented database approach to better estimate the magnitude of
  SOC sequestration potential of agricultural soils. With high-resolution (30 m)
  soil maps of Africa developed by the International Soils Database (iSDA) and
  Malawi as a case study, we create a national adjustment using site-specific
  soil data retrieved from 1160 agricultural fields. We use a benchmark approach
  to estimate the amount of SOC Malawian agricultural soils can sequester,
  accounting for edaphic and climatic conditions, and calculate the resulting
  carbon gap. Field measurements of SOC stocks and sequestration potentials were
  consistently larger than iSDA predictions, with an average carbon gap of
  4.42 ± 0.23 Mg C ha−1 to a depth of 20 cm, with some areas exceeding 10
  Mg C ha−1. Augmenting iSDA predictions with field data also improved
  sensitivity to identify areas with high SOC sequestration potential by
  6%—areas that may benefit from improved management practices. Overall, we
  estimate that 6.8 million ha of surface soil suitable for agriculture in
  Malawi has the potential to store 274 ± 14 Tg SOC. Our approach illustrates
  how ground truthing efforts remain essential to reduce errors in
  continent-wide soil carbon predictions for local and regional use. This work
  begins efforts needed across regions to develop soil carbon benchmarks that
  inform policies and identify high-impact areas in the effort to increase SOC
  globally.
