abstract: Implementing sustainable production practices to rehabilitate soils is
  a grand challenge of our day, particularly for resource-poor farmers. The West
  African Sahel requires attention to balancing the need for increasing
  agricultural production against harsh environmental conditions. While there is
  much research documenting technologies for soil regeneration in the Sahel,
  there has been limited focus on how agricultural practices contribute or
  exacerbate these efforts. Previous assessments of agricultural practices in
  this region have been largely descriptive, and some soil ameliorating
  practices have been promoted with little empirical evidence on their
  effectiveness. Here we systematically review the literature on soil fertility
  and conservation practices that have been studied within West African Sahelian
  agricultural systems. We identified practices in the West African Sahel that
  have been tested to improve soil fertility and reduce land degradation, and
  summarized the outcomes of these practices. A unique contribution of this
  review is the assessment of site-specific conditions and contexts under which
  practices are most effective in studies which recorded these specific
  characteristics. We found that research in this area is dominated by chemical
  fertilizer and organic amendment practices, with moderate to few studies
  focused on soil and water conservation, crop diversification, or agroforestry.
  Additionally, most studies consisted of single practices rather than combining
  practices that target the range of biophysical limitations farmers face in
  agricultural production. These limitations highlight the need for increased
  research testing combinations of practices across long-term on-farm studies to
  generate stronger evidence of conditions under which practices best perform.
  These findings provide key lessons for research and extension on sustainable
  agricultural management under the challenging conditions of the Sahel.
